# Java & Logic 

Just a frontend boi who realized Java is actually the goat. I'm here to solve DSA problems and prove that you can love backend logic without being a CSS wizard.

## 🛠️ The Vibe
* **Java:** My main weapon of choice.
* **Not CSS:** Life is too short to center a div.

## 📂 What's inside?
Daily DSA solutions pushed via LeetSync. 
The goal is simple: Get better at logic, one commit at a time.
